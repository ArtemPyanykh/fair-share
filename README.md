## Contributing guidelines for collaborators

If you want to add a new feature or fix a bug, you will need to follow the following process

1. Pick an open issue from the [open list](https://github.com/ArtemPyanykh/fair-share/issues) _or_ create a new one
2. Branch off `master`
3. Do your work in the branch (**do not commit directly to master**)
4. Open a PR, put `Connects <issue number>` or `Fixes <issue number>` in the PR description
5. Poke other collaborators to review your PR
6. If another collaborator is happy for your PR to be merged, they will put a name-label on it. See [example](https://github.com/ArtemPyanykh/fair-share/pull/11)
7. After getting **at least one** approval, you can merge your branch into `master`
8. Rinse and repeat.
